          Anyone can write a unit test. But a <strong>great</strong> unit test?
        </p>
        <p>
          Great unit tests focus on what a user should see and do,
          <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/testing-implementation-details"
            >not the implementation details</a
          >. They fail when you break your UX. They don’t break when you
          refactor your code.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Great unit tests help you focus on your users, not yourself.</b>
        </p>

        <p>But this introduces a contradiction.</p>

        <p>
          Your sales and service reps talk to users every day. They understand
          how people want to use your product, but don’t have the technical
          skills to turn that knowledge into tests. Your engineers know how to
          code, but don’t have the time to get on the phone with hundreds of
          people a day.
        </p>

        <p>
          The people that understand your users can’t write tests. And the
          people that write tests don’t understand your users. So what do you
          do?
        </p>

        <p>You sit in meetings and hope for the best.</p>

        <p>But what if there was a better way?</p>

        <h3>Enter Sveste: a no-code GUI for writing great unit tests.</h3>

        <p>
          Today, Sveste (Svelte + test) translates form inputs into executable
          tests. It uses the
          <a href="https://testing-library.com/">Testing Library</a> to focus on
          best practices like testing what’s actually on screen. It uses
          <a href="https://vitest.dev/">Vitest</a> so you can take advantage of
          Vite’s fast build times and run unit tests as you code. It structures
          your code so that each unit test is (human) readable and independent (
          <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-nesting-when-youre-testing"
            >no nested mock statements here</a
          >
          ). Sveste ensures that your test code is concise, functional, and best
          practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          But this is just a first step to a bigger goal (literally, it’s
          v0.2!).
        </p>

        <p>We want Sveste to help you write tests in plain English.</p>

        <p>
          Imagine if writing tests were as easy as Mad Libs? Imagine if you got
          context-aware tips as you wrote your tests: guiding you towards
          helpful resources, and steering you away from common testing mistakes?
          Imagine if you could share unit tests with others, and build off of
          each-other’s work to write application agnostic tests?
        </p>

        <h3>Help us make this vision a reality!</h3>

        <p>
