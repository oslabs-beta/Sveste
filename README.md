# Sveste

Sveste helps you write good unit tests for Svelte applications.

Sveste is built on Svelte, Vite, Express, and MongoDB. Our testing suite uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), the [Svelte Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/svelte-testing-library/intro/), and [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/).

## What is a good unit test?

Sveste was built with Kent Doddâ€™s advice in mind. Especially the [Testing Trophy](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-testing-trophy-and-testing-classifications) and (not) [testing implementation details](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/testing-implementation-details). Sveste nudges you to follow these basic rules:

1. Test what a user can see and do.
2. Test one unit at a time.
3. Test each unit in isolation.

## What Makes a Test?

<!-- define parts of a test eg. Assertions, mocking, queries, etc. -->
